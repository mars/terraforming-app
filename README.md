ðŸ”¬ðŸš§ This is a community proof-of-concept, [MIT license](LICENSE), provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.

ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥ To enable the [Postgres backend](https://github.com/mars/terraform/blob/v0.11.9-pg.02/website/docs/backends/types/pg.html.md) for Terraform, this app uses the `terraform` binary built from an unmerged pull request to Terraform (see: [hashicorp/terraform #19070](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/19070)).

ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ To enable the [Build resource](https://github.com/mars/terraform-provider-heroku/blob/v1.6.0-build_resource.01/website/docs/r/build.html.markdown) for Terraform Heroku provider, this app uses the `terraform-provider-heroku` plugin binary built from an unmerged pull request to the provider (see: [terraform-providers/terraform-provider-heroku #149](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-heroku/pull/149)).

Manual setup
------------

```bash
export APP_NAME=my-app
git clone https://github.com/mars/terraforming-app
cd terraforming-app/

heroku create $APP_NAME --buildpack mars/terraforming
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql

# Use our fork of Terraform that supports Postgres backend
# https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/19070
# 
heroku config:set TERRAFORM_BIN_URL=https://terraforming-buildpack.s3.amazonaws.com/terraform_0.11.9-pg.02_linux_amd64.zip

# Set credentials for the Terraform Heroku provider
heroku config:set HEROKU_API_KEY=xxxxx HEROKU_EMAIL=x@example.com

# Set Terraform input variables
heroku config:set TF_VAR_example_app_name=$APP_NAME-example

git push heroku master
```

Usage
-----

Deploy your Terraform HCL code to the app, and then run Terraform in one-off dynos:

```bash
heroku run terraform init
heroku run terraform apply
heroku run terraform output
```

Running apply, you'll see output like this:

```
$ heroku run terraform apply
Running terraform apply on â¬¢ terraforming... up, run.3842 (Free)

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + heroku_app.example
      id:                <computed>
      all_config_vars.%: <computed>
      config_vars.#:     <computed>
      git_url:           <computed>
      heroku_hostname:   <computed>
      internal_routing:  <computed>
      name:              "mars-terraforming-example"
      region:            "us"
      stack:             <computed>
      uuid:              <computed>
      web_url:           <computed>


Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

Terraform waits here, to verify the actions Terraform will take. Type `yes` to proceed.

```
heroku_app.example: Creating...
  all_config_vars.%: "" => "<computed>"
  config_vars.#:     "" => "<computed>"
  git_url:           "" => "<computed>"
  heroku_hostname:   "" => "<computed>"
  internal_routing:  "" => "<computed>"
  name:              "" => "mars-terraforming-example"
  region:            "" => "us"
  stack:             "" => "<computed>"
  uuid:              "" => "<computed>"
  web_url:           "" => "<computed>"
heroku_app.example: Creation complete after 1s (ID: mars-terraforming-example)

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Once the run completes, you can fetch outputs from the configuration, like the app URL from the included example:

```bash
heroku run terraform show example_app_url
```

With the included example, you may easily view the app's build log using curl:

```bash
curl "$(heroku run terraform output example_app_build_log_url)"
```
